# Custom-Leds  
## This is a very small and basic project for my setup  
It consists of addressable leds powered by arduino  
This will look something like this when completed  
![lights](lights.jpeg)  

# Here is the schematics for it

And a 3D View

I will flash custom software in arduino for the lights to match the average color of my laptop to give it a cool look , for now there is the basic firmware for it work  

# Here is the BOM
